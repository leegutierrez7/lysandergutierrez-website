# Optimizing React Performance: Advanced Techniques

React applications can become slow if not optimized properly. Here are advanced techniques to keep your React apps running smoothly.

## Memoization Strategies

### React.memo for Components

```jsx
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  return <div>{/* expensive rendering */}</div>
})
```

### useMemo for Expensive Calculations

```jsx
const ExpensiveCalculation = ({ items }) => {
  const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
    return items.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.value, 0)
  }, [items])
  
  return <div>{expensiveValue}</div>
}
```

## Virtual Scrolling

For large lists, implement virtual scrolling:

```jsx
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window'

const VirtualizedList = ({ items }) => (
  <List
    height={600}
    itemCount={items.length}
    itemSize={50}
  >
    {({ index, style }) => (
      <div style={style}>
        {items[index].name}
      </div>
    )}
  </List>
)
```

## Concurrent Features

React 18's concurrent features help with performance:

- **Suspense boundaries** for better loading states
- **startTransition** for non-urgent updates
- **useDeferredValue** for debouncing expensive operations

## Bundle Optimization

- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Analyze bundle size with tools like Bundle Analyzer
- Remove unused dependencies

## Conclusion

Performance optimization is crucial for user experience. Start with profiling, identify bottlenecks, and apply these techniques strategically.
